1. App has 2 pages (views)
    1. A root route AKA home page - this renders to application/hello view 
    - this view should be able to tell if a user is logged in 
        - if a user is NOT logged in, show a login link
        - if a user is logged in, the page should say "hi #{name} and provide logout link

View/Application/Hello 
    **This view is used for when someone IS logged in and it provides a logout link 
    ** The logout link works using the session destroy action - and the button is a hyperlink that says logout 
        <h1>Hi, <%= session[:name] %>.</h1>
        <%= form_tag ({controller: 'sessions', action: 'destroy', method: 'post'}) do %>
        <input type=submit value='logout'>
        <% end %>



2. A login page
    - Users can enter their name in a form and click login - the app remembers this session 
    - if the user does not enter a name, they are not logged in 
        - return them to the login page 


        <%= form_tag ({controller: 'sessions', action: 'create', method: 'post'}) do %>
        <input name=name>
        <input type=submit value='login'>
        <% end %>
